Using the above technologies create a game of hangman

For this assignment i used for loops, event listeners and functions to create a game of hangman. Global variables are declared at the begginning and there is a function which starts the game by selecting a random word from the wordbank array then breaking up that word into individual letters and storing the newly separated letters in a new variable which is also an array.

the program then evaluates whether the user input matches any of the letters in the randomly selected word's array and outputs that letter or decreases the number of guessses avaliable to the user.

if the user does not guess the word according to the number of avaliable guesses, the user will lose the game. user wins the game if they guess each word before running out of turns to guess each word.
